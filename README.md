## GeoPlay

This is a project that was meant for me to learn new stuff, I wanted to try out [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), so thats what I did.

I wanted to make a fun small game that challenges the users geographic knowledge, by calculating the score by doing some "advanced" match using the amount of correct countries and the time it took to finish the game
